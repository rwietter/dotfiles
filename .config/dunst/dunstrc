    # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken

    ### Legacy

    # This setting is provided for compatibility with older nVidia drivers that
    # do not support RandR and using it on systems that support RandR is highly
    # discouraged.

    # is connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen
    # layout changes.

    # * none: Don't do anything.

    #              invoke it. If there are multiple and no default, open the context menu.
    # * close_current: Close current notification.

    # will be executed in sequence.
